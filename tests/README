In this directory you can find all socket_wrapper tests. All tests can also be
executed outside of the 'make test' environment and without socket_wrapper.

This can be done with:

TORTURE_SERVER_ADDRESS_IPV4="127.0.0.1" \
TORTURE_SERVER_ADDRESS_IPV6="::1" \
TORTURE_SERVER_PORT=7777 \
./tests/test_echo_tcp_write_read

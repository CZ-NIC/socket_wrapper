SOCKET_WRAPPER
==============

This is a modification of initial socket_wrapper (https://cwrap.org/socket_wrapper.html) library. 
Essence : functionally both libraries are equal. But here implemented some minor changes intended 
to ensure the possibility of using arbitrary IP addresses instead of private-range IP addresses.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

More details can be found in the manpage:

  man -l ./doc/socket_wrapper.1

or the raw text version:

  less ./doc/socket_wrapper.1.txt

For installation instructions please take a look at the README.install file.

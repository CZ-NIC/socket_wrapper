TODO
=====

Library:
---------

* Add IP_PKTINFO support for sendmsg/recvmsg.
* Add support for fd passing in sendmsg/recvmsg.
  Scenario:
  We accept a connection from a client and need to pass the fd to another
  child we forked. socket_wrapper then needs to send the 'struct socket_info'
  to the child first and set it up there.
  Or do it like swrap_accept() and call getpeername() and getsockname().
* Add support for threading.

Testing:
---------
* Add a test to make sure detect stale file descriptors.
* Add a test for sento() to broadcast 255.255.255.255.
* Add a test to check that read/readv/send/ only work on connected sockets.
* Add unit tests for conversion functions like convert_in_un_remote().
* Add threaded tests.
